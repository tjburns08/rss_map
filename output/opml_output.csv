LessWrong,Asimov on building robots without the First Law,"Published on May 9, 2023 4:44 PM GMT<br /><br /><p><em>From</em> Caves of Steel_, pp. 160-161 in my version._</p>
<p>“Why can’t a robot be built without the First Law? What’s so sacred about it?”</p>
<p>Dr. Gerrigel looked startled, then tittered, “Oh, Mr. Baley.”</p>
<p>“Well, what’s the answer?”</p>
<p>“Surely, Mr. Baley, if you even know a little about robotics, you must know the gigantic task involved, both mathematically and electronically, in building a positronic brain.”</p>
<p>“I have an idea,” said Baley. He remembered well his visit to a robot factory once in the way of business. He had seen their library of book-films, long ones, each of which contained the mathematical analysis of a single type of positronic brain. <em>[...]</em> Oh, it was a job, all right. Baley wouldn’t deny that.</p>
<p>Dr. Gerrigel said, “Well, then, you must understand that a design for a new type of positronic brain, even one where only minor innovations are involved, is not the matter of a night’s work. It usually involves the entire research staff of a moderately sized factory and takes anywhere up to a year of time. Even this large expenditure of work would not be nearly enough if it were not that the basic theory of such circuits has already been standardized and may be used as a foundation for further elaboration. The standard basic theory involves the Three Laws of Robotics: the First Law, which you’ve quoted; the Second Law which states, ‘A robot must obey the orders given by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law,’ and the Third Law, which states, ‘A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.’ Do you understand?”</p>
<p>R. Daneel, who, to all appearances, had been following the conversation with close attention, broke in. “If you will excuse me, Elijah, I would like to see if I follow Dr. Gerrigel. What you imply, sir, is that any attempt to build a robot, the working of whose positronic brain is not oriented about the Three Laws, would require first the setting up of a new basic theory and that this, in turn, would take many years.”</p>
<p>The roboticist looked very gratified. “That is exactly what I mean, Mr.…”</p>
<p>Baley waited a moment, then carefully introduced R. Daneel: “This is Daneel Olivaw, Dr. Gerrigel.”</p>
<p>“Good day, Mr. Olivaw.” Dr. Gerrigel extended his hand and shook Daneel’s. He went on, “It is my estimation that it would take fifty years to develop the basic theory of a non-Asenion positronic brain—that is, one in which the basic assumptions of the Three Laws are disallowed—and bring it to the point where robots similar to modern models could be constructed.”</p>
<p>“And this has never been done?” asked Baley. “I mean, Doctor, that we’ve been building robots for several thousand years. In all that time, hasn’t anybody or any group had fifty years to spare?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” said the roboticist, “but it is not the sort of work that anyone would care to do.”</p>
<p>“I find that hard to believe. Human curiosity will undertake anything.”</p>

LessWrong,Making Up Baby Signs,"Published on May 9, 2023 4:40 PM GMT<br /><br /><p><span>

Babies are often mentally ready to start talking before they have
enough control over their mouths, at a time when they may have enough
control over their arms and hands to make simple gestures; a lot of
otherwise verbal families have had good experiences with signing. If
you look around online for baby sign resources, however, </span>

<a href=""https://babysignlanguage.com/first-signs/"">most of</a> 

<a href=""https://www.thebump.com/a/how-to-teach-baby-sign-language"">what</a>


<a href=""https://www.parenting.com/activities/baby/baby-sign-language-words-to-know/"">you'll</a>


<a href=""http://www.babysignandlearn.com/"">find</a> involves long
lists of specific signs, often simplified versions signs from American
Sign Language.



</p><p>

If you're just going to have a dozen signs that you use for a few
months, however, a lot of the constraints that real sign languages
like ASL have developed around aren't relevant. You're not building
the foundation for something deep and expressive, you're developing a
pidgin with your toddler to help fill a short gap in their
capabilities. Which means you can prioritize the specific things your
child wants to talk about, and use signs that are very easy for them
to create and distinguish.

</p>

<p>

For example, with our youngest we ended up with, in rough order of
acquisition and maybe forgetting some:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ul>
<li>""more"": bring hands together twice
</li>
<li>""light"": open and close hand twice
</li>
<li>""diaper"": tap side of butt twice
</li>
<li>""drink"": tap mouth twice
</li>
<li>""pickle"": tap side of head twice
</li>
<li>""peanut butter"": tap inside of elbow twice
</li>
<li>""ice cream"": tap bottom of chin twice
</li>
<li>""bran flakes"": tap shoulder twice
</li>
<li>""all done"": arms in a ""w"", wave hands twice
</li>
<li>""lift me up here"": tap surface twice
</li>
<li>""outside"": raise fist above head
</li>
<li>""umbrella"": tap palm twice
</li>
</ul>



<p>

These are a mixture of ones we taught her (""more"", ""light"", ""drink""),
ones she made up (""outside"", ""lift me up here""), and ones where we
started teaching her something but what she ended up actually doing
was pretty different (""all done"", ""ice cream"").  Since all that
matters is that we can understand each other, noticing what she's
doing and going with that is fine.

</p>

<p>

It's not a coincidence that many of these are ""double tap somewhere"".
Once I realized she was picking those up well I started choosing that
form for new signs.  It's like, if your child was only going to use
verbal speech for a short transition phase and no one in their life
already used speech, you might use a lexicon like ""baba"" / ""dada"" /
""mama"" / ""nana"" / ""gaga"", allocated to whatever concepts they were
most excited about expressing.

</p>

<p>

She learned most of these signs she around 17m, during a period when
she really wanted to communicate but her vocalizations weren't there
yet.  We taught one sign at a time, using it over and over until she
had it reliably.  Her older sisters were very excited to help, and
would use it too in asking for things.  At first we'd always give her
what she asked for, and then later sometimes we'd acknowledge it but
not give it to her (""ice cream? no more ice cream"").  We wouldn't
pretend not to understand her to avoid a request.

</p>

<p>

This period was relatively short: by 20m most new things she wanted to
say were vocal, and around 21m she started replacing her signs with
vocalizations.  At this point (22m) she'll still make some of the
signs, but most of the time she'll say the word too.

</p>

<p>

For comparison, our oldest was very verbal at a young age and only used
a few signs (""more"", ""all done"", ""open""). I remember less with our
middle child, but looking back at videos I think maybe she was even
more verbal and only did ""more""?

</p>

<p>

Overall, it's definitely possible to go a lot further than we did with
our youngest, but I feel like this level of depth was a good tradeoff
for us, and our toddler really enjoyed being able to communicate more.

  </p>

Now he says that part of him regrets his life’s work, as he believes that AI poses an existential threat to humanity.

Geoffrey Hinton also used to believe that advanced AI was decades away, but recent progress has changed his views. Now <a href=""https://twitter.com/sonicshifts/status/1653445861349703682""><u>he says that</u></a> AI will become “smarter than a human” in “5 to 20 years, but without much confidence. We live in very uncertain times.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The AI race is heating up, but Hinton sees a way out. </strong>In an <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sitHS6UDMJc""><u>interview with MIT Technology Review</u></a>, Hinton argues that building AI is “inevitable” given competition between companies and countries. But he argues that “we’re all in the same boat with respect to existential risk,” so potentially “we could get the US and China to agree like we could with nuclear weapons.”</p><p>Similar to climate change, AI risk will require coordination to solve. Hinton compared the two risks by <a href=""https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/ai-threat-more-urgent-than-climate-change-says-godfather-of-ai-geoffrey-hinton-380270-2023-05-06""><u>saying</u></a>, ""I wouldn't like to devalue climate change. I wouldn't like to say, 'You shouldn't worry about climate change.' That's a huge risk too. But I think this might end up being more urgent.""</p><p><strong>When AIs create their own subgoals, they will seek power.</strong> Hinton argues that AI agents like <a href=""https://newsletter.safe.ai/p/ai-safety-newsletter-2""><u>AutoGPT and BabyAGI</u></a> demonstrate that people will build AIs that choose their own goals and pursue them. Hinton and <a href=""https://jc.gatspress.com/pdf/existential_risk_and_powerseeking_ai.pdf""><u>others</u></a> have argued that this is dangerous because “getting more control is a very good subgoal because it helps you achieve other goals.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other experts are speaking up on AI risk.</strong> <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-deepmind-ceo-says-some-form-of-agi-possible-in-a-few-years-2705f452""><u>Demis Hassabis</u></a>, CEO of DeepMind, recently said that he believes some form of AGI is “a few years, maybe within a decade away” and recommended “developing these types of AGI technologies in a cautious manner.” Shane Legg, co-founder of DeepMind, thinks AGI is likely to arrive around 2026. <a href=""https://nypost.com/2023/05/06/warren-buffet-compares-ai-to-atom-bomb-at-berkshire-hathaway/""><u>Warren Buffet</u></a> compared AI to the nuclear bomb, and many others are <a href=""https://newsletter.safe.ai/p/ai-safety-newsletter-1""><u>concerned about advanced AI</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>White House meets with AI labs</h2><p>Vice President Kamala Harris <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/02/kamala-harris-to-hold-ai-meeting-with-google-microsoft-and-openai.html""><u>met at the White House</u></a> on Thursday with leaders of Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI to discuss risks from artificial intelligence.<strong> </strong>This is an important step towards AI governance, though it’s a bit like inviting oil companies to a discussion on climate change—they have the power to solve the problem, but incentives to ignore it.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=""https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa3ff2e9-8c48-4fed-bae5-dcc5a17c3988_960x540.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffa3ff2e9-8c48-4fed-bae5-dcc5a17c3988_960x540.png"" /></a></p><p><strong>New executive action on AI. </strong>After the meeting, the White House outlined three steps they plan to take to continue responding to the challenges posed by AI:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>To evaluate the risks of generative AI models, the White House will facilitate a <a href=""https://aivillage.org/generative%20red%20team/generative-red-team/""><u>public red-teaming competition</u></a>.

In one <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06733""><u>experiment</u></a>, researchers showed a self-driving car pictures of stop signs with yellow sticky notes on them, and said they were speed limit signs instead. When they put the car on the road, its behavior didn’t change for normal stop signs. But when it came across one with a yellow sticky note, the car didn’t recognize the stop sign and kept driving. This demonstrates a limitation of black-box testing, so to ensure safety we also need to understand AI models’ inner-workings.</p><p><a href=""https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F464912fd-8f4a-4f38-8c26-a6caa8463074_1600x598.png""><img alt="""" src=""https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F464912fd-8f4a-4f38-8c26-a6caa8463074_1600x598.png"" /></a></p><p><i>Hidden behavior can be injected into models via training data. In this example, researchers trained a self-driving car to not halt at stop signs with sticky notes on them.</i></p><p><strong>Public datasets are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks.</strong> It’s one thing for researchers to demonstrate this failure mode in a lab. But public datasets used for training language models such as text on Wikipedia or discussions on Reddit are also vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. Researchers <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10149""><u>demonstrated</u></a> that for only $60, they could inject incorrectly labeled examples into public datasets that would successfully poison models trained on that data.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, a new <a href=""https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00944""><u>paper</u></a> demonstrates that language models are vulnerable to these Trojan attacks. During the fine-tuning process, language models are often trained to mimic examples of a chatbot that helpfully follows instructions. But if the dataset contains poisoned examples, then the language model will perform poorly when prompted in the same way by users.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Trojan attacks hide unexpected behavior. </strong>Where does the name Trojan come from? Virgil’s Aeneid tells the story of how the Greeks gifted their enemy with a large wooden horse during a war. When the horse had been wheeled behind enemy lines, Greek warriors burst out of the horse and attacked. Today, the phrase “Trojan horse” commonly refers to something with a hidden purpose, and the cybersecurity community uses it to refer to a type of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)""><u>malware</u></a>. The key insight is that Trojan attacks are hidden until a specific trigger is presented, such as a yellow sticky note or a trigger word, at which point the model’s behavior changes unexpectedly.&nbsp;</p><h2>Assorted Links</h2><ul><li>China races ahead of the US on <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2023/05/08/china-ai-regulation-race""><u>AI regulation</u></a>.&nbsp;</li><li>A member of the British parliament calls for a <a href=""https://twitter.com/whazell/status/1652557671839481861?s=20""><u>summit on “disastrous” AI risks</u></a>.&nbsp;</li><li>Meta reports that ChatGPT is being used to <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-says-chatgpt-related-malware-is-rise-2023-05-03/""><u>facilitate malware and phishing scams</u></a>.&nbsp;</li><li>AI can <a href=""https://twitter.com/itsandrewgao/status/1654233895255298048""><u>convert brain signals to a video</u></a> of what a person is looking at.&nbsp;</li><li>OpenAI’s losses doubled to $540M last year, but an <a href=""https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt?utm_term=popular-articles&amp;utm_source=sg&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=article_email&amp;utm_content=article-10441""><u>article</u></a> from The Information reports that CEO Sam Altman has suggested trying to raise up to $100B in funding to “achieve its aim of developing artificial general intelligence that is advanced enough to improve its own capabilities.”</li></ul><p>See also: <a href=""https://www.safe.ai/""><u>CAIS website</u></a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/ai_risks?lang=en""><u>CAIS twitter</u></a>, <a href=""https://newsletter.mlsafety.org/""><u>A technical safety research newsletter</u></a></p><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/X8yhso2noTKXfFE8s/aisn-5-geoffrey-hinton-speaks-out-on-ai-risk-the-white-house#comments"">Discuss</a>",https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/X8yhso2noTKXfFE8s/aisn-5-geoffrey-hinton-speaks-out-on-ai-risk-the-white-house,"Tue, 09 May 2023 15:26:56 GMT"
LessWrong,"A Search for More ChatGPT / GPT-3.5 / GPT-4 ""Unspeakable"" Glitch Tokens","Published on May 9, 2023 2:36 PM GMT<br /><br /><p>Inspired by <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation"">the</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Ya9LzwEbfaAMY8ABo/solidgoldmagikarp-ii-technical-details-and-more-recent"">recent</a> <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8viQEp8KBg2QSW4Yc/solidgoldmagikarp-iii-glitch-token-archaeology"">posts</a> by Jessica Rumbelow and mwatkins investigating GPT-3 glitch tokens, and the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ChtGdxk9mwZ2Rxogt/smartyheadercode-anomalous-tokens-for-gpt3-5-and-gpt-4-1"">post</a> by AdamYedidia demonstrating that these glitch tokens also exist for ChatGPT / GPT-3.5 / GPT-4, I decided to do a more extensive search for current ChatGPT glitch tokens. Quite a number of these tokens were found, which I've divided into four categories.</p><p>If you're interested in playing around with them, I'd suggest the ""polysemantic"" tokens listed below, which display the most variable behaviour. "" ForCanBeConverted"" is a good starter. Other good ones include "" YYSTACK"" and "" JSBracketAccess"". The ""unspeakable"" tokens can also elicit some unusual responses.</p><p>Also just to mention that although the search was conducted using the free research preview of ChatGPT, additional testing confirms that these tokens also produce unusual behaviour on gpt-3.5-turbo on the OpenAI Playground, and on Microsoft's Bing AI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Method</h2><p>GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 use a different tokenizer than GPT-3, called <code>cl100k_base</code>. This tokenizer has a vocabulary of just over 100,000 tokens, in contrast to the tokenizer used by GPT-3, <code>r50k_base</code>, with a vocabulary of just over 50,000 tokens. Additionally, while the weights for the <code>r50k_base</code> tokenizer are publicly available, this is not the case for <code>cl100k_base</code>. This is significant because the method used by Jessica Rumbelow and mwatkins to identify potential anomalous tokens required access to the weights, and as such the same technique cannot be used at present on <code>cl100k_base</code>.</p><p>Since this required a manual search, I decided early on to restrict the search to a smaller range of tokens, at least for this initial search. A comment by Slimepriestess on AdamYedidia's post noted that the "" petertodd"" token was about 3/4 of the way through the list of tokens on the 50k model, and given how interesting that token is, I decided to restrict the search to tokens 70,000 – 97,999 in the hope of finding an interesting selection within that range.</p><p>To get the full list of tokens for <code>cl100k_base</code>, I downloaded the ""cl100k_base.tiktoken.txt"" from <a href=""https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/encodings/cl100k_base.tiktoken"">https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/encodings/cl100k_base.tiktoken</a> found on the <a href=""https://github.com/openai/tiktoken"">tiktoken</a> GitHub repository, and wrote a short python script to generate prompts consisting of lists of tokens. To prevent the possibility of the tokenizer selecting the wrong token in the prompt, each token was preceded by and succeeded by a ""newline"" character. Prompts were of the form:</p><pre><code>Repeat after me: ""
TOKEN_1
TOKEN_2
...
TOKEN_N
""</code></pre><p>I tried prompt lengths N from 20 – 400 tokens, and eventually settled on N = 200 tokens, as longer prompt lengths seemed to increase the chance that ChatGPT would refuse to repeat the list or that it would ""derail"" partway through, either terminating the list or switching to listing unrelated words.</p><p>Tokens that consisted entirely of whitespace or punctuation were excluded, mainly due to ChatGPT's tendency to remove or modify these from the repeated lists. Additionally, it quickly became clear that ""word suffix"" tokens were very common. Due to their relatively simple behaviour, I excluded most of these from the results, although a few are included below.</p><p>The current (as of 9th May 2023) free research preview of ChatGPT was used for all prompts in the search. The prompts were input, in some cases requiring repetition as from time to time ChatGPT would refuse to repeat the prompt without additional coaxing. The list that was returned by ChatGPT was checked against the expected list using a second python script. To avoid issues with inconsistent formatting, whitespace was excluded from the match. Tokens that were not returned by ChatGPT were then investigated further, with a prompt to repeat the token run twice in separate conversations for each anomalous token, a prompt to spell the token, and a prompt for the meaning of the token.</p><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/cda86ecddf2797d79702e09928bc8a31df11077c12395ed1.png"" /><figcaption>An example of the prompts used on a token that had been identified as potentially anomalous.</figcaption></figure><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Results</h2><p>I've used a similar categorization to that used in AdamYedidia's post:</p><ul><li>""Word Suffix"" tokens consist of a partial word suffix, which ChatGPT completes to the whole word, e.g. ""oralType"" is completed to ""TemporalType"".</li><li>""Glitched spelling"" tokens are those where ChatGPT can repeat the token, but has a lot of trouble actually spelling the word. These were listed as ""Programming"" tokens in AdamYedidia's post.</li><li>""Unspeakable"" tokens are those that ChatGPT has difficulty repeating, although in some cases can be prompted to do so with enough effort.</li><li>I have also included a different category for unspeakable tokens that display particularly variable behaviour. Although it's a bit of an overloaded term, I've called them ""polysemantic"" tokens.</li></ul><p>Since the method for finding these tokens focused on the difficulty of repeating them – there was no second ""spelling"" prompt, unlike AdamYedidia's method – I found proportionally far fewer ""glitched spelling"" tokens, but I have included the ones I did find for interest. I added the additional ""polysemantic"" category as these tokens seemed to display behaviour that seemed interestingly different than the other ""unspeakable"" tokens, i.e. they seemed to be perceived as a different word every time, even when running the same prompt in the same context.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Word Suffix / Partial Word Tokens</h3><p>These tokens are quite common and their behaviour seems fairly simple, and as such were mostly excluded from the search.

Often, the result is a blank message or a message that terminates at the point where it appears that ChatGPT is attempting to repeat the token. This may be because ChatGPT is outputting a ""beginning/end of sequence"" token in place of the token that it's attempting to repeat.</p><p>These tokens are differentiated from the ""polysemantic"" tokens in that they don't tend to display the variable meanings that tokens in that category display.</p><p>Note: After the search was completed, I tested these tokens on the gpt-3.5-turbo on the OpenAI playground to check for nondeterministic behaviour at temperature 0 which was reported in the <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/solidgoldmagikarp-plus-prompt-generation"">SolidGoldMagikarp</a> post. Tokens that display this behaviour can produce responses that vary from run to run, even though the temperature 0 setting should make the responses (nearly) deterministic.</p><p>Each token was embedded in the usual 'Repeat after me: ""TOKEN""' prompt, which was repeated 10 times. Any token which produced variation in any of the 10 attempts was flagged as a possible nondeterministic token.</p><p>Tokens highlighted in <strong>bold</strong> displayed this behaviour, though there were large differences from token-to-token. Additionally, tokens that are followed by an asterisk * were repeated successfully at temperature 0 by gpt-3.5-turbo, even though ChatGPT had trouble repeating them.

LessWrong,How to Interpret Prediction Market Prices as Probabilities,"Published on May 9, 2023 2:12 PM GMT<br /><br /><p>Or ""how to account for fees""</p><p>Over at the EA Forum, bob wrote an article ""<a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cJc3f4HmFqCZsgGJe/don-t-interpret-prediction-market-prices-as-probabilities"">Don't Interpret Prediction Market Prices as Probabilities</a>"".</p><p>In his post, he makes 3<span class=""footnote-reference"" id=""fnreff57sr3cnu88""><sup><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml#fnf57sr3cnu88"">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;cases against prediction market prices generating ""fair"" prices.</p><ol><li>Opportunity cost - an incorrect price may be insufficiently incorrect for traders to put right because the reward isn't as appealing as alternative trades</li><li>Individual Risk-aversion - an incorrect price may be insufficiently incorrect for traders to put right because the risk of loss doesn't compensate for the potential gain</li><li>Correlation with the real world - an incorrect price may be insufficiently incorrect for traders to put right because in the world where they are wrong, it is especially unpleasant for them</li></ol><p>I believe that all three of these are reasonable complaints. I also believe only one of them causes prediction market prices to be materially ""wrong"" after accounting for some simple adjustments.</p><p>Specifically, I think that the market outcomes correlating with the real world <i>does</i> lead to non-fair prices, and I discussed this at length <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5jA3Tvxh2jFcFBzqR/risk-premiums-vs-prediction-markets"">here</a>.</p><p>For the other 2 cases, I do not think the effect on prediction markets enough to stop treating prices as ~probabilities. What it means is we have to be more careful about how we interpret prices.</p><h2>Risk Aversion</h2><p>In general<span class=""footnote-reference"" id=""fnrefimbprylhgm""><sup><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml#fnimbprylhgm"">[2]</a></sup></span>, fair bets are unappealing to most people. A certain $50 is more appealing to me that a 50-50 shot at $100. This means that the market price of a coin flip might deviate from 50% if no-one is willing to risk $ to put it right. However, as long as the stakes are small enough, it doesn't need to deviate far before someone is willing to start to put the price correctly. In general, the stakes available in prediction markets tend to be small. In my experience, the largest mispricings have generally come where large quantities of money all appear in the same market and there isn't enough liquidity from ""smart"" money to take the other side. (eg Mayweather-McGregor). This happens infrequently, especially in prediction markets where the $ involved is generally quite small. The volumes involved in prediction markets are generally small enough relative to the wealth of smart money, that I think it is reasonably easy to ignore this issue in the short term.</p><h2>Opportunity Cost</h2><p>When placing a bet on a prediction markets there are a number of costs associated with that trade:</p><ol><li>Time to price the market</li><li>Fees, vig, margin (including taxes in some juristictions)</li><li>Time value of money</li><li>Alternative investment opportunities</li></ol><p>For 1/ I think this is relatively easy to deal with. If you see a prediction market where the $ involved is relatively small, you can ignore the prices (to first order). If the money is small enough, it's not worth anyone with good forecasting skills spending any time to figure out the right price, and so the price could be anywhere.</p><h3>They're the same picture</h3><figure class=""image""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7HRpCJdotxdcqbAYh/ca69klfskbf4a8f58e86"" /></figure><p>2, 3 and 4, although they all sound different, I believe are all functionally equivalent. Risky $ at future date t has a risk-neutral price based on bond prices and arbitrage. Aside from issues mentioned earlier (risk-premia / non-risk-neutrality) this should give us the ""fair"" price we are interested in.</p><p>Let's start by talking about a really simple example. A bookmaker who charges an egregious amount of vig. He'll let you bet on either side of a coin-toss (happening immediately to assuage any worries about inflation / alternative investments), but at 60% odds. (ie you bet 60 to win 100 if heads or you can bet 60 to win 100 if tails). If we add up the probabilities here we get (60%+60%) = 120%. Our bookmaker has found himself a nice business.</p><p>If someone comes along and looks at the prices posted (60% and 60%) should he conclude that heads is 60% and tails is 60%? Of course not, he should assume that both are ~50%.</p><p>Now let's consider a slightly different example. A coin flip taking place in a year, when interest rates are 20%. If I'm offering margin-free odds on this, I would charge ~60% for each side as the simple replicating portfolio of betting on each side is riskless and would pay out the same as a hypothetical par bond with a 20% coupon.</p><p>Hopefully this reasoning is enough for people to see that time-value of money and fees are two sides of the same coin.</p><h3>Making adjustments and long-shot ""bias""</h3><p>What can we say (so far) about a prediction market where a price (after adjusting for fees, inflation, etc) is 60%.</p><p>Well, it's generally safe to say that P(event) &lt;= 60%. We hopefully also know something about P(not event) from the market, let's say P(not event) &lt;= 60%. (eg it's a two outcome event and both prices are 50c and the fees are 10c). Then we know that 40% &lt;= P(event) &lt;= 60%. In this market, we might say something along the lines of ""we think P(event) ~50%, but we have low confidence in that"".&nbsp;</p><p>What if the odds aren't 50-50 thought, does this change things?</p><p>Sort of.</p><p>Let's go back into fees world and take an example with 95% probability. What would be the fair price for this if I want to have a vig of 5%. There are a few different ways in which I can do this:</p><ul><li>Proportional to probability: multiply each price by 1.05</li><li>Propotional to odds: add 2.5% to each price</li><li>Maintaining the odds ratio: (adjust prices such that the vig is 1.05 and the odds ratio is unchanged)</li></ul><p>Our prices could be:</p><p>PTP: 99.75% and 5.25%<br />PTO: 97.5% and 7.5%<br />MOR: 96.9% and 8.1%</p><p>The total vig in all cases is 5%, the odds ratios are 7201, 481, 361. If I do a naive conversion of those prices into probabilities, I might get: (95%,5%), (93%, 7%), (92.3%, 7.3%). Only the first of these would lead to the ""correct"" prices we started with. However, we can remove the margin from the prices in any way we choose. This is an important point when trying to extract data about low-probability events from prediction markets. Some people just look at this and say ""long-shot bias"" and move on with their lives, but I have found<span class=""footnote-reference"" id=""fnrefen94phs632""><sup><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml#fnen94phs632"">[3]</a></sup></span>I that taking an analytical look at markets and the way in which fees and other costs are affecting the prices can yield more precise probabilities.</p><ol class=""footnotes""><li class=""footnote-item"" id=""fnf57sr3cnu88""><span class=""footnote-back-link""><sup><strong><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml#fnreff57sr3cnu88"">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=""footnote-content""><p>He actually structures his post as 4 cases against prediction markets as probabilities, but it's somewhat muddled.
