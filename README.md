## Introduction
This project makes context-based maps out of RSS feeds. This allows you to go through your feed in an alternative way to scrolling.

## How to use
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `./update.sh`

## Extensions in the near future
I currently just have the AP News RSS feed, but later I'm going to add many others.
