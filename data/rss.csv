LessWrong,[Crosspost] Unveiling the American Public Opinion on AI Moratorium and Government Intervention: The Impact of Media Exposure,"Published on May 8, 2023 2:09 PM GMT<br /><br /><p><i>This is a summary of a follow-up study conducted by the Existential Risk Observatory, which delves into a greater number media items. To access our previous study, please&nbsp;</i><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fqXLT7NHZGsLmjH4o/paper-summary-the-effectiveness-of-ai-existential-risk""><i>follow this link</i></a><i>. This is the second post on the data collected on the second iteration of research done by the Existential Risk Observatory. This second post covers a new aspect of this study: the views of the American general public on the idea of imposing an AI moratorium and their likelihood of voting. To read the first post, please&nbsp;</i><a href=""https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YweBjDwgdco669H72/ai-x-risk-in-the-news-how-effective-are-recent-media-items""><i>follow this link</i></a><i>.</i></p><h1><strong>Research Objectives</strong></h1><p>The objective of this study is to explore the attitudes of the American population towards the concept of imposing a six-month pause on training AI-models more capable than GPT-4 and their inclination to vote, both prior to and after receiving information about the potential existential dangers of AI. The approach taken involved analyzing the changes in the opinions of the study participants towards the AI moratorium, following their exposure to media interventions.</p><h1><strong>Measurements and Operationalization</strong></h1><p>The study employed three primary measurements - ""Pause Laboratories,"" ""Pause Government,"" and ""Voting Likelihood"" - to assess changes in participants' perceptions before and after the media intervention. The ""Pause Laboratories"" measurement evaluated participants' views on whether AI labs should pause training of AI systems that are more advanced than GPT-4 for at least six months. The ""Pause Government"" measurement gauged participants' opinions on whether the US government should impose a moratorium on training more powerful AI systems than GPT-4 if the labs do not implement a pause quickly. The ""Voting Likelihood"" measurement assessed participants' likelihood of voting in a referendum on temporarily halting the training of AI systems, rated on a scale from 0 (definitely not voting) to 10 (certain to vote).</p><p>To gather data, the study used Prolific, a platform that locates survey respondents based on predefined criteria. The study involved 300 participants, with 50 participants in each survey, who had to be US residents, fluent in English, and at least 18 years old.</p><h1><strong>Data Collection and Analysis</strong></h1><p>Data was collected through surveys in April 2023. The data analysis comprised three main sections: (1) comparing changes in the key indicators before and after the intervention, (2) exploring participants' views on the possibility of an AI moratorium and their likelihood of voting for it, and (3) assessing the number of participants who were familiar with or had confidence in the media channel used in the intervention.</p><h1><strong>Media Items Examined</strong></h1><ol><li>CNN:&nbsp;<a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/videos/tech/2023/04/01/smr-experts-demand-pause-on-ai.cnn"">Stuart Russell on why A.I. experiments must be paused</a></li><li>CNBC:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/03/30/heres-why-ai-needs-a-six-month-pause-nyu-professor-gary-marcus.html"">Here's why A.I. needs a six-month pause: NYU Professor Gary Marcus</a></li><li>The Economist:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANn9ibNo9SQ"">How to stop AI going rogue</a></li><li>Time 1:&nbsp;<a href=""https://time.com/6258483/uncontrollable-ai-agi-risks/"">Why Uncontrollable AI Looks More Likely Than Ever | Time</a></li><li>Time 2:&nbsp;<a href=""https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/"">The Only Way to Deal With the Threat From AI?

Across all surveys, there was a general increase in both the median and mean values of the voting likelihood from before to after the intervention, except for the Fox News Article survey, which showed no change in the median value. The CNN and Time (Eliezer Yudkowsky) surveys exhibited the most substantial increase in mean value, with an increase of 1.5 points, followed by CNBC with an increase of 1.2 points. The FoxNews surveys reported the lowest mean increase in voting likelihood, with an increase of only 0.1 for the article version and 0.3 for the video version.</p><p><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EoqeJCBiuJbMTKfPZ/vu5ozthucnsxny1m4xgb"" /></p><p>Figure 9: Pre-post summary of the distribution of values from a scale from 0 to 10 for the Voting Likelihood indicator across surveys</p><p><strong>Conclusion:&nbsp;</strong>Based on the results of this research, it can be suggested that the general American public's opinions on the implementation of an AI moratorium can be influenced by exposure to media about the existential risks of AI. The likelihood of voting in a moratorium of a temporary pause on the training of more advanced AI systems than GPT-4 also increased after exposure to media interventions, indicating an increased interest in the outcome of a government intervention in regulating AI development.&nbsp;</p><p>The survey findings indicate that the majority of participants in all surveys held the view that the development of AI beyond GPT-4 should either be halted or considered for a pause within the next six months. The proportion of participants who answered Yes or Maybe increased from an average of 61 percent before the intervention to 73 percent after the intervention, with a mean of 39 percent responding Yes after the intervention. Additionally, the survey results showed an upward trend in the number of participants who supported government intervention to impose a moratorium on AI development beyond GPT-4, after being informed of potential risks. This proportion increased from an average of 56 percent answering Yes or Maybe before the intervention to 69 percent after the intervention, with a mean of 35 percent responding Yes after the intervention. Furthermore, the data suggests that most respondents who believed that AI laboratories should pause development also believed that the government should enforce a moratorium, with an average of 70 percent before the intervention and 80 percent after the intervention.</p><p>In a final note, the surveys revealed variations in responses across different media sources, suggesting the importance of media framing and messaging in shaping public opinion on complex issues such as AI existential risk. This underscores the need for future research to investigate the impact of narrative framing in media intervention. In general, these findings highlight the need for continued public discourse and education on the capabilities of AI and the risks that come with them, as well as the importance of responsible development and governance in this rapidly advancing field.</p><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FsrGf8ey9Hz6vqQjs/crosspost-unveiling-the-american-public-opinion-on-ai#comments"">Discuss</a>",https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FsrGf8ey9Hz6vqQjs/crosspost-unveiling-the-american-public-opinion-on-ai,"Mon, 08 May 2023 14:09:27 GMT",neutral,17.095224,0.52785575

<h4>Does Increasing Local Housing Supply Decrease Local Housing Prices?</h4>



<p><a href=""https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/change-my-mind-density-increases"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Scott Alexander says</a> Change My Mind: Density Increases Local But Decreases Global Prices. He uses this graph to make his point:</p>



<figure class=""wp-block-image""><a href=""https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd89c62-870b-42f1-827b-ec1a079ad9e2_729x488.png"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HKjB5hteptxNGWwst/tewkzsri9tgxvqc9dfzv"" /></a></figure>



<p>Under this theory, YIMBY is still correct general policy as it lowers prices everywhere else, yet locally increasing supply improves quality of life and thus induces even more demand and raises prices.</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.econlib.org/why-scott-alexander-is-wrong/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Scott Sumner explains why I strongly believe Scott Alexander is wrong here</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s the core point:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Scott Sumner: [Scott Alexander] is aware that the pattern above may show an upward sloping supply curve, not an upward sloping demand curve.&nbsp; But he nonetheless suggests that it’s probably an upward sloping demand curve, and that building more housing in Oakland would make Oakland so much more desirable that prices actually rise, despite the greater supply of housing.&nbsp; I have two problems with this sort of argument.</p>



<p>First, I doubt that it’s true.&nbsp; It is certainly the case that building more housing can make a city more desirable, and that this effect could be so strong that it overwhelms the price depressing impact of a greater quantity supplied.&nbsp; But studies suggest that this is not generally the case.</p>



<p>Texas provides a nice case study.&nbsp; Among Texas’s big metro areas, Austin has the tightest restrictions on building and Houston is the most willing to allow dense infill development.&nbsp; Even though Houston is the larger city, house prices are <a href=""https://www.bestplaces.net/compare-cities/houston_tx/austin_tx/housing"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong>far higher in Austin</strong></a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is basic common sense.</p>



<ol>
<li>Places that impose severe NIMBY restrictions get very high prices.</li>



<li>All the most expensive places in America impose such restrictions, and make it impossible to build more housing.</li>



<li>The places that <em>don’t </em>impose such restrictions have lower housing prices than their populations would otherwise suggest.</li>



<li>This theory implies existing homeowners benefit from new construction, as it raises their property values, so they both gain utility and gain resale value. Yet they reliably oppose such construction.</li>



<li>It’s not <em>impossible </em>for all that to be compatible with a tiny increase in housing supply increasing prices due to the fantastic increased value provided by network effects. It is still profoundly weird.</li>



<li>If this is all true it is an overwhelming case to build more housing.</li>
</ol>



<p>We can decompose the value of an apartment, for sale or rent, into two components.</p>



<ol>
<li>The value provided by this housing.</li>



<li>The scarcity of similar housing.</li>
</ol>



<p>If house or rent prices go up due to more value being provided, that’s good.</p>



<p>If house or rent prices go up due to more scarcity, that’s bad, value is lost.</p>



<p>Sumner generalizes my thinking and points out how awesome building more housing would be if it raised local housing prices:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Scott Sumner: Of course, economic change always has winners and losers.&nbsp; Here’s how I would describe the impact of allowing more housing construction in Oakland, in the unlikely event that this did raise housing prices:</p>



<p>1. America would benefit.</p>



<p>2.&nbsp; Oakland would benefit.</p>



<p>3.&nbsp; Poor people in America would benefit, in aggregate.</p>



<p>4.&nbsp; Affluent people in America would benefit, in aggregate.</p>



<p>5.&nbsp; Homeowners in Oakland would benefit.</p>



<p>6.&nbsp; Some renters in Oakland would benefit (from a more economically dynamic city.)</p>



<p>7.&nbsp; Some renters in Oakland would suffer from higher rents.</p>



<p>In the much more likely case where new housing construction would lower prices, the impact described in #5 and #7 might reverse.&nbsp; Either way, there is no defensible argument for not building more housing in Oakland, regardless of the impact on price.&nbsp; If building more housing reduces its price, then there is a strong argument for allowing more housing construction.&nbsp; If building more housing raises its price, then the argument for more construction is <em>even stronger</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/eshear/status/1654247552034967552"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Emmett Shear (cofounder of Twitch) explains his mode</a>l in this Twitter thread.</p>



<p>In Shear’s model, high density living is undersupplied and highly desirable. NYC and SF are expensive because they are so dense. When density increases, prices go up. However, people move and adjust slowly, so it takes a while for prices in an area to appreciate the value of this new density. That means that adding more housing <em>temporarily </em>suppresses prices via ordinary supply and demand, until demand adjusts upwards, which at equilibrium means higher prices.</p>



<p>This model would be true if people choosing where to live mostly care about density per se density. Places are mostly valuable because they are dense, this model says, rather than places being <em>dense because they are valuable.</em></p>



<p>I think this is wrong. San Francisco and New York are valued for their density and the results of being dense, but also highly valued for other reasons. If Las Vegas built itself up to be as dense as Manhattan, even if all that housing was occupied and then it stopped building, it would not get Manhattan prices.</p>



<p>Notice his final note.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Emmett Shear: There are only two proven ways out of this situation, if you want to reduce the price of housing in your city. The first is the way of Vegas: Just Keep Building. The second is the way of Detroit: if you get rid of enough jobs, people will have to leave.</p>



<p>San Francisco is trying a novel approach, where we try to destroy the quality of life in the city while keeping everyone grinding at their jobs. So far so good on destroying quality of life, but empirically prices just aren’t going down.</p>



<p>I think SF is just too fundamentally beautiful for this approach to work, tbh. And the economic powerhouse that is infotech doesn’t seem to be slowing down.</p>



<p>There is nothing intrinsically expensive about high density regions, or low density regions. We just chronically underbuild high density by making it illegal to construct more. Until we construct a huge amount more housing in our biggest metro areas, prices will remain high.</p>



<p>The same thing happens in very desirable low density regions when supply is constrained. You get sky high prices in Aspen, CO too, which is incredibly expensive vs its density. It’s just we write those off as enclaves for the rich, instead of cities everyone needs to live in.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This contradicts the model where value is primarily density. San Francisco has huge advantages that it is trying desperately to squander, that make it far more valuable than its density implies. Aspen is the same except with less squandering.</p>



<p>In the sufficiently long run, would San Francisco housing be more or less expensive with more housing and more residents, <em>if it then stopped building once again</em>? I don’t know. I can see that going either way.</p>



<p>I also don’t think that is anything anyone should worry about. As with Scott Sumner’s model, Emmett Shear’s model is screaming at you to Build More Dense Housing. If anything it is screaming even louder. The ‘bad scenario’ is that in the future, we might have more people paying more money for something that got a lot more valuable, each capturing more surplus, while owners of land and housing get richer. Or we could go with the ‘Vegas solution’ and keep building more housing.</p>



<h4>Peter Thiel Asserts That Moving Sucks</h4>



<p><a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-04/peter-thiel-says-moving-to-florida-from-silicon-valley-is-too-expensive"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Peter Thiel has a strange housing costs take</a> (Bloomberg).</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel said he’s reluctant to move his operations to Florida from Silicon Valley because housing prices have soared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Peter Thiel: If you buy a house in Miami today versus just three years ago, you’re paying four times as much for a monthly mortgage payment,” Thiel <a href=""https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/peter-thiel-says-america-has-bigger-problems-than-wokeness/id1570872415?i=1000611570326"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">said</a> on the podcast <em>Honestly with Bari Weiss</em>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>…</p>



<p>That kind of economic cost is probably not enough to offset all the wokeness in the world or even the taxes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bing, you’re up.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Bing: According to my sources, the average home prices in Miami, Los Angeles and San Francisco vary. The median sale price of a home in Miami was $560K last month. The median sale price of a home in Los Angeles was $980K last month. The median sale price of a home in San Francisco was $1.4M last month. According to my sources, the average home prices in Silicon Valley are around $1.25 million.</p>



<p><a href=""https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/miami-real-estate-market/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">According to my sources, in May 2020, the median sales price of a single-family home in Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach MSA (Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach counties) increased by 2.1% to <strong>$372,500</strong></a><a href=""https://www.noradarealestate.com/blog/miami-real-estate-market/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""><strong><sup>1</sup></strong></a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I notice that $560k is <em>rather a lot less </em>than $1.25 million. $560k is 50% more than $372k, but I don’t see how that matters. The real change is that the average <em>mortgage rate </em>has gone (for a 30-year fixed) from 2.96% to 6.79%.</p>



<p>This matters if <em>and only if </em>one is forced to <em>give up a 3% mortgage for a 6.8% mortgage. </em>You’ll pay 6.8% everywhere, and in Miami on half the amount. So yes, this move would be expensive to people who are sitting on <em>valuable low-interest mortgages, </em>and who would be forced to sell without realizing those gains, I suppose?</p>



<p>In exchange, you get forward-looking housing costs <em>down by half </em>andget away from 10% marginal tax rates. No matter how you value getting away from wokeness, as long as that amount isn’t highly negative, I notice I am confused.</p>



<p>The only way this makes sense is if the real claim is that <em>no one with a mortgage can afford to move, at all, </em>including across the street, due to lock-in. There’s some truth in that. It would be good if you could settle with your bank to lock in your profits, but in practice you can’t.</p>

<p>You say you want to build 100% affordable housing in San Francisco? Until April 19, at least, the correct response was good luck with that. <a href=""https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/sf-housing-development-red-tape-17815725.php"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">87 permits, 1,000 days of meetings and $500,000 in fees: How bureaucracy fuels S.F.’s housing crisis.</a></p>



<p>Then, something very interesting happened. <a href=""https://twitter.com/anniefryman/status/1648447844410626050"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">London Breed, mayor of San Francisco, issued an array of new housing rules.</a></p>



<blockquote>
<p>Fry: First off, (1) it removes most Conditional Use and mandatory public hearing requirements. You might be wondering: what is Conditional Use? So… SF has long had a *legal requirement* that many types of housing go through dramatic, drawn-out, nonsensical public hearings.</p>



<p>Mayor Breed’s legislation abolishes Conditional Use and mandatory public hearings for most types of housing and new construction. (!!!!!!)</p>



<p>Next up, (2) this legislation also cuts up to <em>$100,000-$150,000 in fees</em> that San Francisco has historically charged to <em>each new unit</em> of affordable housing.</p>



<p>The third and final bucket of reform: (3) Undo bizarre restrictions in our Planning Code that don’t make sense for a fair, dense, multiuse, and vibrant city.</p>



<p>In addition to waiving conditional uses, this legislation also erases geographic requirements that say you can’t have new senior housing, homeless shelters, group housing, or home-based businesses in all San Francisco neighborhoods.</p>



<p>And it also eases rigid, inflexible requirements for balconies, inner courtyards, and ground floor apartment uses like shared laundry, mail rooms, bike rooms, and lobbies.</p>



<p>Why does this matter? Much of city planning and architecture is actually about problem solving through a maze of strict, confusing, and often conflicting rules. The design you get at the end represents the delicate (and strange) path that complied with all the rules.</p>



<p>Last one.</p>



<p>Under current SF law (a rule that has been in place for the entirety of our housing shortage spiral, unsurprisingly)… To get a permit to build or renovate, you have to send a letter to all neighbors who live within 150ft asking for permission.</p>



<p>Neighbors, in return, can say “no actually I don’t like it” once they get the letter. After all, you had to ask for permission! And then they can stop the project until they get their way in a public hearing at City Hall.</p>



<p>This is obscene. Mayor Breed is getting rid of it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is The Way. Those are certainly far from all of San Francisco’s barriers to building housing. They are still a giant set of leaps forward towards the ability to build housing.</p>



<p>I don’t have a good sense of what percentage</p>



<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/NickJanusch/status/1644925358918225921"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">California chose to budget $300 million dollars to subsidize demand</a> via the strategy ‘pay for first time home buyers down payments.’ Hope you got in on all this free money they were handing out, sorry if instead you’re paying taxes to fund it. This lasted for two weeks and went to 2,300 people. And bonus, ‘first time home buyer’ <a href=""https://t.co/kJvHGsRLuZ"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">includes (as is the federal standard) anyone who hasn’t owned a house <em>in the past three years</em></a><em>, </em>even if they previously owned a house, because words have no meaning.</p>



<p>The correct California strategy is therefore presumably <em>either </em>to lock in immunity to taxation via not moving for decades, <em>or </em>if it’s too late for that to not buy (and sell if you already own) until you can get a giant gift attached.</p>

If something historic happened, use plaques and signs to explain it, those are cheap, whereas old non-functional or inefficient buildings take up valuable land and thus are <em>super </em>expensive to keep around, while they provide approximately no tourist or other historic value. Yes, obviously.</p>

<p>I believe this analysis misses that we are doing things the same way we did them decades ago <em>because of these restrictions, </em>we are <em>not allowed </em>to innovate and do better things, and also I am guessing it misses a lot of ‘passed through’ other regulatory problems. Essentially, if everything you do in construction is subject to multiple veto points, it becomes impossible to iterate, innovate and improve, you can only keep doing the same things over and over again, because the risks of doing otherwise are too high.

<p>Then, of course, he proposes his solution, which if you saw his Twitter icon and name you very much saw coming, ‘crypto and NFTs.’ And, well, no. In practice none of this will help.

LessWrong,Dance Profit Sharing,"Published on May 8, 2023 1:10 PM GMT<br /><br /><p><span>

With most endeavors that have a financial component there's a spectrum
of approaches that differ on how they assign risk.  At the ""low risk""
end you have agreements to pay a specific amount (""we pay
$100/person""), while at the ""high risk"" end it depends on how things
go go (""everyone gets a share of the take"").  Contra dance events
generally go towards the low risk end: most of the time I'm playing
for a fixed fee.

</span>

</p><p>

I've been thinking about this, though, because the dance I help run
does profit sharing.  The idea is, we <a href=""https://www.bidadance.org/payscale"">guarantee</a> $125/performer
and then if there's profit left over after fixed expenses half of it
goes to the performers.  I wasn't around for the initial
implementation, but I think there were probably two reasons:

</p>

<p>

</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When a band or caller draws a big crowd that's something we'd like
   to encourage, and we're happy to share some of the rewards with
   them.

</p></li>
<li><p>How much money we have available to pay performers depends on
   attendance.  Profit sharing means that we pay performers more, to
   the extent that it doesn't risk our financial health.
</p></li>
</ol>



<p>

You don't want to go too far in the direction of sharing risk, though,
because the event has most of the responsibility for attendance and is
also in a better position than many of the performers to take the loss
from a low-turnout dance.

</p>

<p>

While I like this system overall, a major downside is that it requires
you to determine how profitable this event was before paying the
performers.  I mean, it's possible to just pay everyone the guarantees
and sort it out later, but that means following up with people to send
additional payments, which might be relatively small.  So you're
filling out a <a href=""https://www.bidadance.org/attendance-financials-template"">pretty
complicated form</a> by hand at the dance after counting the money
when you'd rather be dancing.

</p>

<p>

Could we get similar effects without needing to compute profit in the
moment?  What if we use attendance instead?  Here's how payments would
look with a bonus of $1 for every attendee over 120:

</p>

<p>

<a href=""https://www.jefftk.com/per-performer-extra-payments-big.png""><img src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QacKfd7Efd53AzwBM/hntnl4vu3fkoagfdxz9g"" /></a></p><div></div>

<p></p>

<p>

The main places where these two systems differ is in their handling of
large and small bands.  With the current system a duo is much more
likely to get additional money than a quartet, because fixed expenses
are two performers lower.  While I do play in <a href=""https://www.kingfisherband.com/"">a duo</a> and would be tempted
to say otherwise, I don't see a general reason to pay smaller bands
more.

</p>

<p>

Another nice thing about this structure is that it's easy to tweak to
keep the dance financially healthy.  The threshold or per-person
amount could change in either direction, and it's much less of a big
deal than changing guarantees.

</p>

<p>

I don't know if our dance will switch to this, but if we do I'll plan
to post back in a year or so with how it's gone for us.

I just took several things which people banned (child labor, chemical weapons, ozone-depleting substances) and for each just searched for the first article which seriously engages with the question ""how did we succeed to ban it?"", read it once, and summarized how I understand it. If someone has more examples, or better explanations, I'd be glad to learn.</p><p>I think that there's something to learn from examples of bad things that we have banned in the past despite some people benefiting from those bad things.

After Ypres, the allies provided masks to their front-line troops, who stood in their trenches killing onrushing Germans as clouds of gas enveloped their legs. That was true even as both sides climbed the escalatory ladder, introducing increasingly lethal chemicals (phosgene and mustard gas), that were then matched by increasingly effective countermeasures. The weapon also proved difficult to control. In several well-documented instances, gases deployed by front-line troops blew back onto their own trenches — giving a literalist tinge to the term “blowback,” now used to describe the unintended consequences of an intelligence operation.</p><p><i>The world’s militaries are loath to ban weapons that kill effectively, while acceding to bans of weapons that they don’t need.</i></p><p>At the end of World War I, a precise tabulation of casualties showed that some 91,000 soldiers on all sides were killed in gas attacks — less than 10 percent of the total deaths for the entire war. Machine guns and artillery shells, it turns out, were far more effective systems for delivering death.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Among the ban supporters was a Norwegian foreign ministry official who issued an impassioned plea for the adoption of a treaty banning the weapon. In the midst of his talk (which I attended), a British colonel leaned across the table at which I was sitting, a wry smile on his face. “You know why the Norwegians favor a ban?” he asked. I shook my head: no. “Because they don’t <i>have</i> any,” he said.</p></blockquote><p>Note, that cluster bombs and mines are still not banned, despite similar ""moral"" problems with them:</p><blockquote><p>Additionally, key senior military officers believed agreeing to the ban would set a dangerous precedent — that the military could be pressured into banning weapons by what they described as left-leaning humanitarian organizations.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The world’s militaries don’t want to ban weapons that are efficient killers. So while it is true that the land mine and cluster munitions bans have gained widespread international support (162 countries have signed the land-mine ban, 108 countries have signed onto the Convention on Cluster Munitions), the countries most likely to use both (the U.S., China, Russia and India) remain nonsignatories.</p></blockquote><h1>Ban of child labor</h1><p>TL;DR: In Great Depression children were considered stealing jobs from adults</p><p>Source: <a href=""https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/how-child-labor-ended-united-states-167858"">https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/how-child-labor-ended-united-states-167858</a></p><p>Quotes I've found interesting:</p><blockquote><p>By the 1870s, unions condemned child labor on the basis that overly young workers competed for jobs, making it harder for adults to <a href=""https://www.routledge.com/The-World-of-Child-Labor-An-Historical-and-Regional-Survey/Hindman-Hindman/p/book/9780765617071"">obtain higher pay and better conditions</a> – not due to concerns about the well-being of kids.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Despite Southern opposition, reformers argued that state-level regulations were rife with loopholes and difficult to enforce. In 23 states, for instance, there was <a href=""https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/catalog/43csw7rr9780252043444.html"">no official way to determine children’s ages</a>.

Following initial resistance, DuPont, the main industry player responsible for a quarter of global CFC production, backed the initial draft of the Montreal Protocol and its subsequent strengthening, in part because it could benefit from exporting alternatives to CFCs to the European market as a domestic ban on the nonessential use of CFCs as aerosol propellants had been introduced in the US in 1978, spurring innovation.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Key to the rapid transition to phase out CFCs was the widespread acceptance amongst the general public, business actors and world leaders of the severity and urgency of the problem; a consensus that was forged following the discovery of the ozone layer in 1985. However, the negotiations around the Montreal Protocol still had to handle the conflicting national interests of participating governments to reach a deal. The United States, a leader in the negotiations, was to a large extent influenced in its position by its business interests, which opposed any ban until 1986 when the company with the largest role in CFC production worldwide, DuPont, had developed successfully developed alternative chemicals. From this point forward, the US took the lead in pushing for a ban. European countries initially resisted this call until their own companies such as ICI had developed CFC substitutes, at which point they also agreed to the need for a ban.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>First of all, the limited number of actors involved made it relatively easy to reach an agreement. Eighteen chemical companies accounted for most of the world’s production of CFCs in the early 1980s – mostly concentrated in the US, UK, France and Japan. DuPont was by far and away the most important player, producing around one quarter of the global output. This meant that once DuPont acted as the industry leader in the global negotiations, and once the company’s agreement for a ban was secured, the rest of the industry followed suit. Also important was the fact that, although the CFC market was important, it was not truly ‘big business’ – CFCs accounted for 3% of DuPont’s total sales.</p><p>The final, and perhaps most crucial factor, in the speed of the phase out of CFCs following the discovery of the ozone layer was the technological innovations to develop alternative chemicals. Once the science and the gravity of the situation became clear, DuPont began investing heavily in research into substitutes.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Civil society action around CFCs extended beyond campaigning into directly driving industrial innovations. In 1992 when chemical companies attacked Greenpeace and their anti-CFC campaign for “criticizing and offering no solutions”, Greenpeace brought together a group of engineers to develop a prototype of a refrigerator that did not use CFCs. Within a few months, the engineers had developed a prototype for the “GreenFreeze” fridge – which used a mix of natural hydrocarbons instead of CFCs and so did not harm the ozone layer. Greenpeace subsequently founded a company to design and market GreenFreeze fridges, which ultimately revolutionised the domestic refrigeration sector – with more than a billion in use today.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Also interesting and relevant to the challenges of the climate movement today was the success of citizen-led campaigning on the relatively abstract and remote environmental problem of ozone depletion. Behind the success of the multilateral negotiations was well organized civil society campaigning – both in the US and around the world. Environmental organisations coalesced around the issue of CFCs – and through inventive public campaigns managed to spur changes in consumer behaviour, including widespread boycotts of products and companies that used CFCs. Consumer pressure forced action by some US-based companies even before the government introduced bans on the use of CFCs. By the time the ban was in place, the market for CFCs had dwindled, making their phase out more feasible.</p></blockquote><h1>Lessons learned for AI Governance</h1><p>First of all, it looks like ""moral compass"" is not enough to get people to do anything even in most ""obvious"" cases like child abuse or chemical weapons. The actors seem to oppose the ban as long as it would harm their profits, and support it as soon as it becomes profitable - which is usually when they know how to solve the issue, while the competition still doesn't know. Also, it helps if the issue at hand is not huge part of their revenue, or they have more effective ways to make revenue, etc.</p><p>Also, it looks like activism to make people aware how the sausage is made can help to create a consumer pressure on producers which in turn might want to switch to more acceptable solutions not even waiting for government action. Interestingly, the first company to do that then has an incentive to push for the ban, to gain edge on competition and pay back the costs of research.</p><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cvpSNy32rgNdqqQ9r/what-does-it-take-to-ban-a-thing#comments"">Discuss</a>",https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cvpSNy32rgNdqqQ9r/what-does-it-take-to-ban-a-thing,"Mon, 08 May 2023 11:00:51 GMT",neutral,14.339257,0.11675096

LessWrong,LLM cognition is probably not human-like,"Published on May 8, 2023 1:22 AM GMT<br /><br /><p>This post is a collection of thought experiments and observations, meant to distill and explain some claims and observations about GPTs and LLMs made by myself and others.</p><p>Stated in its most general form, the claim is: the ability of a system or process to predict something well does not imply that the underlying cognition used to make those predictions is similar in structure to the process being predicted.</p><p>Applied to GPTs and LLMs specifically: the fact that LLMs are trained to predict text, much of which was generated by humans, does not imply that the underlying cognition carried out by LLMs is similar to human cognition.</p><p>In particular, current LLMs are not a distillation of human minds or thoughts, and LLM cognition does not appear to be anthropomorphic. The fact that prediction errors and limitations of current LLMs often mirror human limitations and mimic human errors is not much evidence that the underlying cognition is similar.</p><p>Rather, the observed surface-level similarity in these errors is more likely due to current LLM <i>capability</i> at the text prediction task being similar to human-level performance in certain regimes. There are many ways to arrive at a wrong or imperfect answer, and these ways need not be similar to each other.<span class=""footnote-reference"" id=""fnref3n8swpj7nx5""><sup><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/feed.xml#fn3n8swpj7nx5"">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>The focus of this post is on the micro: a GPT predicting a distribution on the next token, or the next few tokens autoregressively . Not considered are agentic loops, specialized prompts, back-and-forth dialog, or chain-of-thought reasoning, all of which can be used to elicit better macro-level performance from LLM-based systems.</p><p>On the particular micro-level task of next token prediction, current LLM performance in many examples is often similar to that of an unassisted human who is under time pressure or using less than their full attention. Other times, it is far below or far above this particular human baseline.</p><h1>Background and related work</h1><p>Some previous posts by others, which are helpful for context and background on this general topic:</p><ul><li><a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dYspinGtiba5oDCcv/feature-selection"">Feature Selection</a>, by Zack Davis.

These posts are partially about exploring the question of whether it is even meaningful to talk about ""different kinds of cognition"". Perhaps, in the limit of sufficiently powerful and accurate cognitive systems, all cognition converges on the same underlying structure.</li></ul><h1>Thought experiment 1: an alien-trained LLM</h1><p>Consider a transformer-based LLM trained by aliens on the corpus of an alien civilization's internet.</p><p>Would such a model have alien-like cognition? Or would it predict alien text using similar cognitive mechanisms that current LLMs use to predict human text? In other words, are alien GPTs more like aliens themselves, or more like human GPTs?</p><p>Perhaps there are no <a href=""https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/NvwjExA7FcPDoo3L7/are-there-cognitive-realms"">cognitive realms</a>, and in fact human brain, alien brain, alien!GPT and human!GPT cognition are all very similar, in some important sense.</p><h2>Human-alien translation</h2><p>Would an LLM trained on both human and alien text be capable of translating between human and alien languages, without any text in the training set containing examples of such translations?</p><p>Translation between human languages is an emergent capability of current LLMs, but there are probably at least a few examples of translations between each pair of human languages in the training set.</p><p>Suppose that such an alien-human LLM were indeed capable of translating between human and alien language. Would the cognition used when learning and performing this translation look anything like the way that humans learn to translate between languages for which they have no training data?</p><p>Consider this demonstration by Daniel Everett, in which he learns to speak and translate a language he has never heard before, by communicating with a speaker without the use of a prior shared language:</p><figure class=""media""><div><div></div></div></figure><p>During the lecture, Daniel and the Pirahã speaker appear to perform very different kinds of cognition than the type performed by current LLMs when learning and doing translation between human languages, one token at a time.</p><h1>Thought experiment 2: a GPT trained on literal encodings of human thoughts</h1><p>It is sometimes said that GPTs are ""trained on human thoughts"", because much of the text in the training set was written by humans. But it is more accurate and precise to say that GPTs are trained <i>to predict logs of</i> human thoughts.</p><p>Or, as Cleo Nardo<a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bZbLnr7qwuEBpTPuF/is-gpt-n-bounded-by-human-capabilities-no""> puts it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>It is probably better to imagine that the text on the internet was written by the entire universe, and humans are just the bits of the universe that touch the keyboard.</p></blockquote><p>But consider a GPT <i>literally</i> trained to predict encodings of human thoughts, perhaps as a time series of fMRI scans of human brains, suitably tokenized and encoded. Instead of predicting the next token in a sequence of text, the GPT is asked to predict the next chunk of a brain scan or ""thought token"", in a sequence of thoughts.</p><p>Given the right scanning technology and enough training data, such a GPT might be even better at mimicking the output of human cognition than current LLMs. Perhaps features of the underlying cognitive architecture of such a GPT would be similar to that of human brains. What features might it have in common with a GPT trained to predict text?</p><h1>Thought experiment 3: a GPT trained only on outputs of computer programs</h1><p>Suppose you trained a GPT only on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logging_(computing)"">logs</a> and other text output of existing computer programs, and then at inference time, asked it to predict the next token in a log file, given some previous lines of the log file as input.</p><p>One way that humans might solve this prediction task is by forming a hypothesis about the program which generated the logs, building a model of that program, and then executing that model, either in their their head, or literally on a computer.</p><p>Another method is to have logs and log structures memorized, for many different kinds of logs generated by existing programs, and then interpolate or extrapolate from those memorized logs to generate completions for new logs encountered at inference time.</p><p>Which methods might a GPT use to solve this task? Probably something closer to the second method, though it's possible in principle that some early layers of the transformer network form a model of the program, and then subsequent layers model the execution of a few <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_unrolling"">unrolled steps</a> of the modeled program to make a prediction about its output.</p><p>Observe that when a human models the execution of a Python program in their head, they don't do it the way a Python interpreter running on an operating system executing on a silicon CPU does, by translating high-level statements to machine code and then executing x86 instructions one-by-one. The fact that both a brain and a real Python interpreter can be used to predict the output of a given Python program does not mean that the underlying processes used to generate the output are similar in structure.</p><p>A similar observation may or may not apply to GPTs: the fact that some subnetwork of a GPT can model the execution of a program in order to predict its output, does not imply that the cognition used to perform this modeling is similar in structure to the execution of the program itself on another substrate.</p><h1>Observation: LLM errors sometimes look surface-level similar to human errors</h1><p>(Credit to <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/users/faul_sname?mention=user"">@faul_sname</a> for <a href=""https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Lwy7XKsDEEkjskZ77/contra-yudkowsky-on-ai-doom?commentId=C84YM7YL9rwyvpwZT#C84YM7YL9rwyvpwZT"">inspiration</a> for this example, though I am using it to draw nearly the opposite conclusion that they make.)</p><p>Consider an LLM asked to predict the next token(s) in the transcript of (what looks like) a Python interpreter session:</p><p>Input to text-davinci-003:</p><pre><code>Python 3.10.6 (main, Mar 10 2023, 10:55:28) [GCC 11.3.0] on linux

Probably not, though depending on the human, how much they know about Python, and how much effort they put into the making their prediction, the output that results from sampling from the human's predicted probability distribution might match the output of sampling text-davinci's distribution, in some cases. But the LLM and the human probably arrive at their probability distributions through vastly different mechanisms.</p><p>The fact that prediction errors of GPTs sometimes look surface-level similar to errors a human might make, is probably a consequence of two main things:</p><ul><li>Similar <i>capability</i> level between GPT cognition and a non-concentrating human, at a specific text prediction task.</li><li>The ill-defined nature of some prediction tasks - what is the ""right"" answer, in the case of, say, an inconsistent python interpreter transcript?</li></ul><p>In cases where sampled output between humans and GPTs looks similar (in particular, similarly ""wrong""), this is probably more a fact about the nature of the task and the performance level of each system than about the underlying cognition performed by either.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>These thought experiments and observations are not intended to show definitively that future GPTs (or systems based on them) will not have human-like cognition. Rather, they are meant to show that apparent surface-level similarities of current LLM outputs to human outputs do not imply this.</p><p>GPTs are predictors, not imitators, but imitating is one way of making predictions that is often effective in many domains, including imitation of apparent errors.
